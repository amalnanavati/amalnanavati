**Overview 👨🏽‍🎓**: I'm a robotics software engineer and researcher, currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Washington advised by [Dr. Sidd Srinivasa](https://goodrobot.ai/) and [Dr. Maya Cakmak](https://www.mayacakmak.io/home).

**Research Goal 🤖**: To develop quality-of-life improving robots that work well with and around people.

**Projects 🧑🏽‍💻**: I have 8 years experience building end-to-end robot systems:
- **ADA 🦾 (2021--present)**: Developed a [robot-assisted feeding system](https://robotfeeding.io/) for people with motor impairments.
    - **Code**: [ada_feeding](https://github.com/personalrobotics/ada_feeding) 🍝, [feeding_web_interface](https://github.com/personalrobotics/feeding_web_interface) 📱, [ada_ros2](https://github.com/personalrobotics/ada_ros2) 💻
- **Stretch 🤖 (Summer 2024)**: Incorporated shared autonomy features into the Stretch mobile manipulator's online interface.
    - **Code**: [stretch_web_teleop](https://github.com/hello-robot/stretch_web_teleop) 🎮, [hello-amal](https://github.com/hello-amal) 🧑🏽
- **Zipline Platform 2 Droid 🛬 (Winter 2023)**: Studied user perceptions of droid motion during delivery, worked with the planning and controls teams to integrate research insights into the autonomy stack.
- **Office Robot 🤖 (2019--2021)**: Developed an office robot that can promote task success by intentionally asking people for help.
    - **Code**: [kuri_wandering_robot](https://github.com/hcrlab/kuri_wandering_robot) 🛞, [kuri_cmm_demo](https://github.com/hcrlab/kuri_cmm_demo) 🧐, [human_help_user_study](https://github.com/amalnanavati/human_help_user_study) 🤝
- **Shopkeeper Robot 🏪 (2018--2019)**: Developed a self-supervised deep learning model to predict socially appropriate shopkeeper responses to customers' multi-modal actions in a store.
    - **Dataset**: [one-to-many human-human interaction](https://www.robot.soc.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/research/dataset-one-to-many-human-human-interaction/) 📈
- **Podi 🧑‍🦯 (2016--2018)**: Developed a guide robot for people who are blind.
    - **Code**: [IROS19-Human-Robot-Coupling](https://github.com/CMU-TBD/IROS19-Human-Robot-Coupling) 🚶‍♀️

**Open Source Contributions 🧑🏽‍💻**: I'm deeply commited to using and contributing to open-source code.
- **New Features ✨**: [pymoveit2](https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/pymoveit2), [moveit2](https://github.com/moveit/moveit2), [py_trees_ros](https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees_ros), and [roslibjs](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/roslibjs).
